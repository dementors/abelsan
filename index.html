    <meta name="description" content="Dr. Abel Sanchez holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is the Executive Director of MIT's Geospatial Data Center, architect of &quot;The Internet of Things\&quot; global network, and architect of data analytics platforms for SAP, Ford, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Boeing. In cyber security, Dr. Sanchez architected impact analysis of large-scale cyber attacks designing Cyber Ranges for the Department of Defense (DOD). In password security, Dr. Sanchez led the design of a password firewall (negative authentication) for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) agency. In machine learning, addressing fraud detection, Dr. Sanchez designed a situational awareness framework that exploits different perspectives of the same data and assigns risk scores to entities for Accenture. He led the design of a global data infrastructure simulator, modeling follow-the-sun engineering, to evaluate the impact of competing architectures on the performance, availability and reliability of the system for Ford Motor Company. Dr. Sanchez led e-Education software for Microsoft via their I- Campus Program and was faculty co-founder of the Accenture Technology Academy, an online resource for over 200,000 employees. He teaches MIT courses on cybersecurity, engineering computation, and data science and has produced over 1000 educational videos. Learners from 45 unique countries have taken Abel's courses.">
